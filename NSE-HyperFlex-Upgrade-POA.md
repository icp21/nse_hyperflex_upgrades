---

### Step 2 â€” UCS Infrastructure Firmware Upgrade (30-60 minutes)

**Goal**: Upgrade Fabric Interconnect A/B to qualified firmware while preserving HA

**Prerequisites:**
- vCenter upgrade completed successfully
- UCS Manager accessible and stable

**Phase 2A - Upload FI Image:**

**Phase 2B - Upgrade Subordinate FI First:**
1. Identify subordinate FI: Equipment â†’ Fabric Interconnects â†’ check HA Status
2. Navigate to: Equipment â†’ Fabric Interconnects â†’ [Subordinate-FI] â†’ General â†’ Firmware Management â†’ Update Firmware
3. Select uploaded firmware bundle and click OK
4. **Monitor FI reboot and comeback (20-30 minutes)**

**Phase 2C - Critical Validation Before Primary FI Upgrade:**

```bash
# 1. Verify cluster state and HA status:
UCSM-A# show cluster extended-state
# Verify: Both FIs show UP, mgmt services UP, HA READY

# 2. Verify Fibre Channel data paths (if applicable):
UCSM-A# connect nxos a
UCSM-A(nxos)# show npv flogi-table
UCSM-A(nxos)# exit

UCSM-A# connect nxos b  
UCSM-A(nxos)# show npv flogi-table
UCSM-A(nxos)# exit
# Record total flogis for both FIs - numbers should match

# 3. Verify Ethernet data paths:
UCSM-A# connect nxos a
UCSM-A(nxos)# show int br | grep -v down | wc -l
UCSM-A(nxos)# exit

UCSM-A# connect nxos b
UCSM-A(nxos)# show int br | grep -v down | wc -l  
UCSM-A(nxos)# exit

# 4. Check for active faults:
UCSM-A# show fault
# Clear any critical faults before proceeding
```

**Phase 2D - Upgrade Primary FI:**
1. **ONLY proceed if ALL validations pass**
2. Follow same firmware update procedure for primary FI
3. **Monitor primary FI reboot (20-30 minutes)**
4. System will be briefly single-homed during primary FI reboot

**Phase 2E - Final FI Validation:**
```bash
# Verify HA restoration and data paths
UCSM-A# show cluster extended-state
UCSM-A# show fabric-interconnect detail
UCSM-A# show server status
UCSM-A# show fault
```

**Rollback Plan:**
- If FI upgrade fails: Restore previous firmware, open TAC case

### Step 3 â€” Combined UCS, HXDP, and ESXi Upgrades

**Goal**: Perform coordinated upgrade of server firmware, HXDP, and ESXi in sequence

#### Step 3a â€” UCS Server Firmware (HUU) Rolling Upgrade (4-6 hours for 8 nodes)

**Prerequisites:**

3. **Select rolling upgrade option (one node at a time)**
4. **Monitor each node upgrade (20-40 minutes per node)**

**Per Node Process:**
- Host enters maintenance mode automatically
- Node reboots and firmware applied
- Host returns to cluster
- **Validate server firmware version in UCS Manager before proceeding to next node**

**Validation After Each Node:**
```bash
# Check cluster health
hxcli cluster show

# Verify UCS server firmware
UCSM-A# show server inventory
```

**Rollback Plan:**
- If node fails to boot: Stop HUU job, restore UCS config, open TAC case

#### Step 3b â€” HXDP Upgrade to 5.5(2b) (60-120 minutes)

**Prerequisites:**

2. **HX Connect â†’ Upgrades â†’ Data Platform**
3. **Select management cluster and run prechecks**
4. **Monitor CVM rolling upgrades** (8 CVMs will upgrade sequentially)
5. **Verify cluster health throughout process**

**Validation:**
```bash
# Verify HXDP version and cluster health
hxcli cluster show
hxcli cluster info

# Confirm all CVMs running HXDP 5.5(2b)
hxcli cluster storage-summary
```

**Rollback Plan:**
- If HXDP upgrade fails: Stop upgrade, run hypercheck, open TAC case
- **DO NOT proceed to ESXi upgrades if HXDP fails**

#### Step 3c â€” ESXi Host Upgrade to 8.0 U3 (8-12 hours for 8 hosts)

**Prerequisites:**

2. **HX Connect â†’ Upgrades â†’ Host Upgrade**
3. **Select all hosts for rolling upgrade**
4. **Choose Cisco ESXi 8.0 U3 bundle**
5. **Monitor host evacuation, upgrade, and return (45-90 minutes per host)**

**Per Host Process:**
- vMotion evacuates VMs from host
- Host enters maintenance mode
- ESXi upgrade applied
- Host reboots and rejoins cluster
- **Validate ESXi version before proceeding to next host**

**Manual esxcli Template (Backup Method):**
```bash

# Reboot and exit maintenance mode
reboot
vim-cmd hostsvc/maintenance_mode_exit
```

**Validation After Each Host:**
- Host summary shows ESXi 8.0 U3
- Host operational in cluster
- No VM placement issues

**Rollback Plan:**
- If ESXi upgrade fails: Rollback to previous version, open TAC case

- Non-production environment allows for extended weekday windows


**Critical Variables Affecting Time:**
- Number of UCS servers (affects HUU duration)
- Number of ESXi hosts (affects host upgrade duration)
- HyperFlex cluster size (affects HXDP upgrade duration)
- Network speed and bundle upload times
- Any unexpected issues requiring troubleshooting
